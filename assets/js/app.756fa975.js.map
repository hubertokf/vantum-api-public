Se a qualquer momento o USUÁRIO não concordar com qualquer parte da Política de Privacidade, o USUÁRIO deve imediatamente parar de usar o SITE e/ou o Serviço.</p>\n\n    <h3>6. PAGAMENTO</h3>\n\n    <p>O acesso ao Serviço requer que o USUÁRIO pague um valor mensal (Assinatura Mensal), exceto quando concedido por parte da Vantum período de uso gratuito - modalidade conhecida como “Freemium”. O acesso a certos recursos do Site pode exigir o pagamento de valores adicionais (processamento de imagens e serviços adicionais) ou ainda mudança no Plano de Assinatura.</p>\n\n    <p>Todos os planos de pagamento serão feitos mediante cobrança em Boletos ou Cartão de Crédito, que deverá ser cadastrado pelo USUÁRIO. O USUÁRIO não poderá cadastrar em sua conta Cartões de Crédito de terceiros, sob pena de exclusão do SITE e demais medidas legais cabíveis.</p>\n\n    <p>Para os planos mensais, o serviço será cobrado automaticamente, antecipadamente e não é reembolsável. Não haverá reembolsos ou créditos para meses parciais de uso do serviço, melhoria ou “rebaixamento” do serviço, o plano sempre ficará disponível para uso até o encerramento do período pago antecipadamente.</p>\n\n    <p>O pagamento para a Vantum será automaticamente renovado ao final do período de assinatura, a menos que o USUÁRIO cancele sua Assinatura Mensal por meio da página de assinatura antes do final do período da assinatura atual. O cancelamento entrará em vigor no dia seguinte ao último dia do período de assinatura atual e o USUÁRIO deixará de ter acesso ao Serviço. No entanto, se o USUÁRIO cancelar a Assinatura antes do final do período de assinatura atual, não será reembolsada nenhuma tarifa de assinatura que já tiver sido paga e o plano permanecerá disponível até o final do período pago antecipadamente.</p>\n\n    <p>A Vantum poderá, a qualquer tempo, alterar o preço dos Planos de Assinatura e de outros serviços onde informará quaisquer alterações de preço ao USUÁRIO com antecedência de ao menos 30 (trinta) dias. As alterações de preços dos Planos de Assinatura e outros serviços entrarão em vigor no início do próximo período de assinatura, após a data da mudança de preço. O USUÁRIO aceitará o novo preço ao continuar usando o Serviço após a alteração de preço entrar em vigor. Se o USUÁRIO não concordar com as mudanças de preços, terá o direito de cancelar a assinatura do Serviço antes da cobrança da primeira mensalidade com o novo valor.</p>\n\n    <p>A Vantum poderá abrir, em determinadas situações, períodos de teste gratuito para novos usuários, sendo certo que o acesso destes usuários poderá ser cancelado a qualquer momento pela Vantum sem qualquer aviso prévio. As especificações sobre o período de teste gratuito serão divulgadas pela plataforma no momento da adesão e cadastro do novo usuário.<br /></p>\n    \n    <h3>7. ACESSO À INTERNET</h3>\n\n    <p>A Vantum não se responsabiliza por falhas de comunicação, de internet, etc. O USUÁRIO é inteiramente responsável pela conexão à internet de capacidade suficiente para a plena operação do SITE e/ou do Serviço.</p>\n\n    <h3>8.

Além das pessoas consideradas por lei como incapazes, também serão impossibilitados de utilizar os serviços pessoas que tenham sido inabilitadas previamente.</p>\n\n    <p>O cadastro é gratuito, no entanto, os serviços oferecidos pela Vantum serão cobrados de acordo com o estabelecido neste TCU.</p>\n\n    <p>Cada USUÁRIO deverá ter apenas um cadastro no SITE. Caso seja identificada a existência de cadastros duplicados, a Vantum poderá inabilitar de forma definitiva todos os cadastros do USUÁRIO no SITE, independentemente de qualquer aviso ou notificação.</p>\n\n    <p>O USUÁRIO declara que todas as informações que forneceu à Vantum para fins de criação de uma conta (Dados de Registro) são verdadeiras, precisas, atuais e completas e sua falha em fornecer tal informação constituirá uma violação deste TCU e poderá resultar na rescisão imediata de sua conta. O USUÁRIO atualizará seus Dados de Registro para mantê-las verdadeiras, precisas, atuais e completas; e manterá a confidencialidade de sua senha.</p>\n\n    <p>Ao criar uma Conta, o USUÁRIO não deve se passar por outra pessoa, nem usar um nome sujeito aos direitos de qualquer outra pessoa sem autorização. O USUÁRIO também se compromete a não usar endereço de e-mail ou nome de usuário que seja ofensivo ou inadequado; nem permitir que qualquer outra pessoa use sua Conta.</p>\n\n    <p>O USUÁRIO entende e concorda que será responsável por todas as atividades que ocorrem sob qualquer Conta criada para seu uso, mesmo se tais atividades não foram por ele cometidas. A Vantum não se responsabiliza por qualquer perda ou dano resultante da sua falha em manter a confidencialidade da sua senha.</p>\n\n    <p>A Vantum poderá recusar qualquer solicitação de cadastro, bem como cancelar um cadastro previamente aceito que esteja em desacordo com este TCU. Fica estabelecido que o cadastramento do interessado, uma vez aprovado e confirmado o pagamento, permitirá a utilização dos serviços do SITE disponíveis no plano contratado.</p>\n\n    <p>O conteúdo das informações inseridas no cadastro é de inteira responsabilidade do USUÁRIO, não sendo a Vantum responsável pela correção ou verificação dos dados pessoais. O USUÁRIO garante e responde, em qualquer caso, civil e criminalmente, pela veracidade, exatidão e autenticidade dos dados pessoais cadastrados.</p>\n\n    <p>Independente do disposto acima, a Vantum poderá, a qualquer tempo e a seu exclusivo critério, verificar os dados pessoais podendo para tanto, solicitar documentos e comprovantes do USUÁRIO para verificação das informações fornecidas.</p>\n\n    <p>Sem prejuízo de outras medidas, a Vantum poderá, a qualquer tempo e, a seu exclusivo critério, advertir, suspender ou cancelar, temporária ou definitivamente, o cadastro de um USUÁRIO, suspendendo a prestação de seus serviços se: </p>\n\n    <ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n      <li>o USUÁRIO descumprir as disposições do presente TCU; </li>\n      <li>descumprir com seus deveres de USUÁRIO; </li>\n      <li>praticar atos fraudulentos ou dolosos; </li>\n      <li>não puder ser verificada a identidade do USUÁRIO ou se verificada que qualquer informação fornecida por ele está incorreta; </li>\n      <li>qualquer atitude do USUÁRIO tenha causado algum dano a terceiros ou ao próprio SITE ou tenham a potencialidade de assim o fazer.</li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <p>A Vantum RESERVA-SE O DIREITO DE EXCLUIR OU BLOQUEAR DADOS DO USUÁRIO SEM ACESSO POR UM PERÍODO SUPERIOR A 6 (SEIS) MESES, SEM PRÉVIO AVISO. O USUÁRIO poderá, a qualquer momento, solicitar a exclusão de seu cadastro. Caso não existam pendências conhecidas a Vantum irá realizar a exclusão do cadastro mantendo em seus arquivos as informações sobre transações realizadas.</p>\n\n    <p>Em caso de perda, extravio ou suspeita de utilização indevida de sua conta, login ou senha, o USUÁRIO deverá notificar a Vantum imediatamente. Neste caso, a Vantum irá bloquear o respectivo cadastro até identificar a melhor maneira de solucionar o problema.</p>\n\n    <p>Em nenhuma hipótese será permitida a cessão, venda, aluguel ou outra forma de transferência da conta de um USUÁRIO a terceiros, assim como a criação de novos cadastros a USUÁRIO cujo cadastro original tenha sido cancelado unilateralmente pela Vantum.</p>\n\n    <p>Serão eliminados apelidos ou nomes de usuário que guardem qualquer semelhança com o nome “Vantum”, bem como os considerados ofensivos, ou que contenham dados pessoais do USUÁRIO ou qualquer propaganda, URL ou endereço eletrônico.</p>\n\n    <h3>9.
