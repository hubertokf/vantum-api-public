O cancelamento entrará em vigor no dia seguinte ao último dia do período de assinatura atual e o USUÁRIO deixará de ter acesso ao Serviço. No entanto, se o USUÁRIO cancelar a Assinatura antes do final do período de assinatura atual, não será reembolsada nenhuma tarifa de assinatura que já tiver sido paga e o plano permanecerá disponível até o final do período pago antecipadamente.</p>\n\n    <p>A Vantum poderá, a qualquer tempo, alterar o preço dos Planos de Assinatura e de outros serviços onde informará quaisquer alterações de preço ao USUÁRIO com antecedência de ao menos 30 (trinta) dias.

Neste caso, a Vantum irá bloquear o respectivo cadastro até identificar a melhor maneira de solucionar o problema.</p>\n\n    <p>Em nenhuma hipótese será permitida a cessão, venda, aluguel ou outra forma de transferência da conta de um USUÁRIO a terceiros, assim como a criação de novos cadastros a USUÁRIO cujo cadastro original tenha sido cancelado unilateralmente pela Vantum.</p>\n\n    <p>Serão eliminados apelidos ou nomes de usuário que guardem qualquer semelhança com o nome “Vantum”, bem como os considerados ofensivos, ou que contenham dados pessoais do USUÁRIO ou qualquer propaganda, URL ou endereço eletrônico.</p>\n\n    <h3>9.
