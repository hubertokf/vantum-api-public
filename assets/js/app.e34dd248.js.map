Neste caso, a Vantum irá bloquear o respectivo cadastro até identificar a melhor maneira de solucionar o problema.</p>\n\n    <p>Em nenhuma hipótese será permitida a cessão, venda, aluguel ou outra forma de transferência da conta de um USUÁRIO a terceiros, assim como a criação de novos cadastros a USUÁRIO cujo cadastro original tenha sido cancelado unilateralmente pela Vantum.</p>\n\n    <p>Serão eliminados apelidos ou nomes de usuário que guardem qualquer semelhança com o nome “Vantum”, bem como os considerados ofensivos, ou que contenham dados pessoais do USUÁRIO ou qualquer propaganda, URL ou endereço eletrônico.</p>\n\n    <h3>9.
