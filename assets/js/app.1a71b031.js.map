CONTAS</h3>\n\n    <p>O SITE e/ou Serviço poderão ser utilizados somente por pessoas maiores de 18 (dezoito) anos que cumpram todos os requisitos previstos no TCU. Além das pessoas consideradas por lei como incapazes, também serão impossibilitados de utilizar os serviços pessoas que tenham sido inabilitadas previamente.</p>\n\n    <p>O cadastro é gratuito, no entanto, os serviços oferecidos pela Vantum serão cobrados de acordo com o estabelecido neste TCU.</p>\n\n    <p>Cada USUÁRIO deverá ter apenas um cadastro no SITE. Caso seja identificada a existência de cadastros duplicados, a Vantum poderá inabilitar de forma definitiva todos os cadastros do USUÁRIO no SITE, independentemente de qualquer aviso ou notificação.</p>\n\n    <p>O USUÁRIO declara que todas as informações que forneceu à Vantum para fins de criação de uma conta (Dados de Registro) são verdadeiras, precisas, atuais e completas e sua falha em fornecer tal informação constituirá uma violação deste TCU e poderá resultar na rescisão imediata de sua conta. O USUÁRIO atualizará seus Dados de Registro para mantê-las verdadeiras, precisas, atuais e completas; e manterá a confidencialidade de sua senha.</p>\n\n    <p>Ao criar uma Conta, o USUÁRIO não deve se passar por outra pessoa, nem usar um nome sujeito aos direitos de qualquer outra pessoa sem autorização. O USUÁRIO também se compromete a não usar endereço de e-mail ou nome de usuário que seja ofensivo ou inadequado; nem permitir que qualquer outra pessoa use sua Conta.</p>\n\n    <p>O USUÁRIO entende e concorda que será responsável por todas as atividades que ocorrem sob qualquer Conta criada para seu uso, mesmo se tais atividades não foram por ele cometidas. A Vantum não se responsabiliza por qualquer perda ou dano resultante da sua falha em manter a confidencialidade da sua senha.</p>\n\n    <p>A Vantum poderá recusar qualquer solicitação de cadastro, bem como cancelar um cadastro previamente aceito que esteja em desacordo com este TCU. Fica estabelecido que o cadastramento do interessado, uma vez aprovado e confirmado o pagamento, permitirá a utilização dos serviços do SITE disponíveis no plano contratado.</p>\n\n    <p>O conteúdo das informações inseridas no cadastro é de inteira responsabilidade do USUÁRIO, não sendo a Vantum responsável pela correção ou verificação dos dados pessoais. O USUÁRIO garante e responde, em qualquer caso, civil e criminalmente, pela veracidade, exatidão e autenticidade dos dados pessoais cadastrados.</p>\n\n    <p>Independente do disposto acima, a Vantum poderá, a qualquer tempo e a seu exclusivo critério, verificar os dados pessoais podendo para tanto, solicitar documentos e comprovantes do USUÁRIO para verificação das informações fornecidas.</p>\n\n    <p>Sem prejuízo de outras medidas, a Vantum poderá, a qualquer tempo e, a seu exclusivo critério, advertir, suspender ou cancelar, temporária ou definitivamente, o cadastro de um USUÁRIO, suspendendo a prestação de seus serviços se: </p>\n\n    <ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n      <li>o USUÁRIO descumprir as disposições do presente TCU; </li>\n      <li>descumprir com seus deveres de USUÁRIO; </li>\n      <li>praticar atos fraudulentos ou dolosos; </li>\n      <li>não puder ser verificada a identidade do USUÁRIO ou se verificada que qualquer informação fornecida por ele está incorreta; </li>\n      <li>qualquer atitude do USUÁRIO tenha causado algum dano a terceiros ou ao próprio SITE ou tenham a potencialidade de assim o fazer.</li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <p>A Vantum RESERVA-SE O DIREITO DE EXCLUIR OU BLOQUEAR DADOS DO USUÁRIO SEM ACESSO POR UM PERÍODO SUPERIOR A 6 (SEIS) MESES, SEM PRÉVIO AVISO. O USUÁRIO poderá, a qualquer momento, solicitar a exclusão de seu cadastro. Caso não existam pendências conhecidas a Vantum irá realizar a exclusão do cadastro mantendo em seus arquivos as informações sobre transações realizadas.</p>\n\n    <p>Em caso de perda, extravio ou suspeita de utilização indevida de sua conta, login ou senha, o USUÁRIO deverá notificar a Vantum imediatamente. Neste caso, a Vantum irá bloquear o respectivo cadastro até identificar a melhor maneira de solucionar o problema.</p>\n\n    <p>Em nenhuma hipótese será permitida a cessão, venda, aluguel ou outra forma de transferência da conta de um USUÁRIO a terceiros, assim como a criação de novos cadastros a USUÁRIO cujo cadastro original tenha sido cancelado unilateralmente pela Vantum.</p>\n\n    <p>Serão eliminados apelidos ou nomes de usuário que guardem qualquer semelhança com o nome “Vantum”, bem como os considerados ofensivos, ou que contenham dados pessoais do USUÁRIO ou qualquer propaganda, URL ou endereço eletrônico.</p>\n\n    <h3>9.
